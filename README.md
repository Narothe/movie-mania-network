## How to install
You need to have "Node.js" (LTS version) downloaded to run the project.
 - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
Throughout the project, I used the "yarn" command to install/add dependencies/run the project. 

- [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable)

```
yarn install
```

## How to start

```
yarn start
```

## Other way to install and start

Inside of files you should find files "project_yarn_install.bat" and "project_yarn_start.bat". You can use them as well to install and start the project.
