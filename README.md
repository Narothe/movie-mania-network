## How to install

You need to have "Node.js" (LTS version is the best) downloaded to run the project.

 - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
 

Throughout the project, I used the "yarn" command to install/add dependencies/run the project. 

- [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable)

```
yarn install
```

## How to start

```
yarn start
```

## Other way to install and start

- Inside of files you should find files "project_yarn_install.bat" and "project_yarn_start.bat". You can use them as well to install and start the project.

- If for some reason you want to use npm:

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```

## Project started. What now?

Open [http://localhost:3000]( http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website.

### The Browsers used while creating project:
